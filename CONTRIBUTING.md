# Contributing to Simprint

Thanks for considering a contribution to Simprint.

This repository is in an active open-source transition. We welcome bug reports, documentation improvements, CI and packaging fixes, frontend refinements, test coverage, and well-scoped product improvements.

## Before You Start

- Search existing issues and discussions before opening a new one.
- For larger changes, open an issue or discussion first so the direction can be aligned before implementation.
- Keep pull requests focused. Small, reviewable changes move faster than broad refactors.

## Development Setup

Windows 从零配置、桌面端启动和可选服务端联调请先阅读 [开发配置文档](./docs/development-setup.zh-CN.md)。

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm` 9
- Rust toolchain
- Tauri system prerequisites for your platform

### Local Run

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
cp src-tauri/config.example.toml src-tauri/config.development.toml
cargo tauri dev --features development
```

If you only need frontend iteration, you can also use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Local Backend

Many contributions do not require a local backend. Documentation updates, CI changes, build fixes, and part of the frontend and desktop-shell work can usually be developed without running the full server stack locally.

If your change touches server-backed flows, workspace resources, or API-dependent behavior, you may also need a self-hosted backend during development.

The desktop application currently handles its main business routes through the embedded SQLite business layer. Only features that explicitly use the standalone HTTP server need the server-side setup described in the development guide.

## Useful Commands

Run these from the repository root unless noted otherwise:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm rust:fmt:check
pnpm rust:check
```

If you changed build, packaging, or release-related code, also run:

```bash
node build.cjs
```

## Pull Request Expectations

- Describe what changed and why.
- Mention any user-facing behavior changes.
- Include validation steps you ran locally.
- Attach screenshots or recordings for UI changes when helpful.
- Avoid mixing unrelated refactors into the same PR.

If your change touches build, release, or workflow files, call that out explicitly in the PR description.

## Issues and Bug Reports

Good bug reports usually include:

- Operating system and environment details
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Clear reproduction steps
- Screenshots, logs, or error messages when available

## Scope and Collaboration

Current high-value contribution areas include:

- Reproducible bug reports and targeted bug fixes
- Build, packaging, and CI improvements
- Documentation and onboarding improvements
- Frontend UX polish and workflow consistency
- Tests, regression coverage, and release verification

The environment runtime is maintained in this repository under `src-tauri/crates/runtime`; the browser-kernel layer (`simprint-browser-kernel`) remains a separate component. Changes to environment lifecycle behavior should include tests in the embedded runtime crate whenever possible.

## Communication

- English and Chinese are both acceptable in issues and pull requests.
- If you want to contribute on a longer horizon, open an issue or discussion and briefly introduce the areas you want to help maintain.
